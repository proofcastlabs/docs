The BitcoinZ Light Client from the Proofcast suite offers an accessible, less resource-intensive way to interact with the Bitcoin blockchain. As interchain operability grows, light clients will be crucial for verifying chain status, such as verifying Bitcoin state on an EVM-compatible chain.

## Key Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof**: Utilizes sp1 and risc0 zero-knowledge proofs.
  - **SP1 zkVM**: Implemented in Rust.
  - **RISC0**: Supports CPU and GPU runs.

## Usage

To integrate and test the BitcoinZ Light Client, follow the instructions provided in the [GitHub README](https://github.com/proofcastlabs/bitcoinzk/blob/master/README.md).
